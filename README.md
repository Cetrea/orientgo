# Overview

**OGo** is a Go client for the OrientDB database.

# Status

This project is in early stages and not usable yet.

I am starting with an implementation of the Binary Protocol for OrientDB version 2 and OrientDB 1.7.x - there are two serialization formats to implement for that also.  Once that is done, then I'll implement support for the HTTP Protocol.  After than I may add support for older versions of OrientDB.

I have no projection for when this will be in a ready state.
