* DONE unit test newly added Read commands in obinary.reader
* DONE split commands into 'server' and 'database' -> separate files
* DONE Do the REQUEST_CONNECT command and then see if DB_EXISTS now works after calling that
* DONE Need to add SUCCESS checks and server error reading to every network command
* DEFERRED ReadVar API / unit test needs cleanup
* TODO Re-evaluate db/network reader API
* TODO Get back to the db call that is returning what looks like serialized content
** If can't make sense of it, change to the csv-serialization and see if that helps figure out the schemaless serialized version
